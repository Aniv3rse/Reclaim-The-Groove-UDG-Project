This is a videogame I made as a fun project for Universidad de Guadalajara, the project was developed in Unity.

The videogame is a simple videogame where you try to clean toxic waste dumped in a forest.

One of the things I wanted to do with this project is learning a bit about artificial intelligence and I made a bear for this simple task.
